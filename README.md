#It Goes Like...
A project by Bryce Kolton
Uses the spotify APIU to play a fun little music exploration game with users. Built for INFO343 at UW. You can find this on http://staff.washington.edu/bbkolton/spotify/ if you want to see a live version.
I did not receive help from anyone to complete this project. I put around 10 or more hours into this. 
I ended up enjoying the openendedness of the challenge, despite fearing it at first.
